# BadLuckInc
A game made for the "Roll of the Dice" game jam in 2022.

For this gamejam, I wanted to start a project which I could revisit and expand on later, rather than just making a short game.

Since time was so short, only a small part of the larger game was implemented, which is part 1 of the following:

1. Doing work as a controllant
   This involves sending masked people to the correct place and when occassionally faced with special types of masks, you will get different events based on where you decide to send them.
   You also have access to a scanner which can check stress and threat level of every masked person you encounter. You can then send them to where you think they belong, or talk to them to
   find out if what they're saying matches the scanner.

2. Going to/from work
   When going into or leaving work, you can choose to explore the BadLuck Inc. building where you can interact with characters and items to access information and trigger events which lead
   to other endings and allows you to learn more about other characters.

3. Being at home
   Differs depending on if it's morning or evening. If it's morning, you can drink your coffee, interact with various things in the house, read the newspaper, use your phone and leave for work.
   In the evening, you can visit message boards dedicated to popular topics, message other characters, eat food and go to bed.

My current plan is to have characters be 2D sprites in a 3D world, with a locked camera in part 1, while allowing the player to roam free in first person in parts 2 and 3.
